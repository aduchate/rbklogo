# rbklogo

A logo interpreter (french+english) written in pegjs for my eldest girl. 

The implementation is very concise with 500 lines of js and peg code combined.

The grammar is not yet complete but covers the basics of the language.

Three examples are provided: ex-arbre, ex-spirale and ex-carres.
